# StoneHearth
This was a year long project for the courses Software Engineering 1 (491) and Software Engineering 2 (492). 

#Overview
For this project we worked in small groups, I worked with one other student for this project. We were told to program a game ourselves and we would use various modeling tools, risk analysis models, etc. on our project. We began working on it during the Spring semester of 2019 and finished in the Fall semester of 2019

StoneHearth takes great inspiration from Hearthstone and we tried to make our game function in a similar manmner.

#Gameplay
Players gain mana every turn, starting at 1 for the player who goes first. Players can spend mana to play a card on the field.
Once a card is played onto the field, it can attack either a card, or the enemies life total.

The game ends when either player reaches 0 hit points.

#Future
When we first added the card functionality we had made it as simple as we could to add new cards. Right now there is only 15 cards total (2 copies of each for a total of 30).

Also, we planned on adding different mechanics similar to Hearthstones, such as: Battlecries (effects that happen when a card is played), Hero Powers (abilities the hero can use once per turn), Taunt (a card that must be killed before any other card or attacking the enemy hero), etc.
